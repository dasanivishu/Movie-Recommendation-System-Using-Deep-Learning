we have used movies reviews provided by the MovieLens 20M dataset, a popular movie ratings dataset containing 20 Million movie reviews collected from 1995 to 2015.
Building Recommender Systems using Implicit Feedback

It is important to understand the distinction between implicit and explicit feedback, and why modern recommender systems are built on implicit feedback.
Explicit Feedback:

In the context of recommender systems, explicit feedback are direct and quantitative data collected from users. For example, Amazon allows users to rate purchased items on a scale of 1–10. These ratings are provided directly from users, and the scale allows Amazon to quantify user preference. Another example of explicit feedback includes the thumbs up/down button on YouTube, which captures users’ explicit preference (i.e. like or dislike) of a particular video.

However, the problem with explicit feedback is that they are rare. If you think about it, when was the last time you clicked the like button on a YouTube video, or rated your online purchases? Chances are, the amount of videos you watch on YouTube is far greater than the amount of videos that you have explicitly rated.

Implicit Feedback:
On the other hand, implicit feedback are collected indirectly from user interactions, and they act as a proxy for user preference. For example. videos that you watch on YouTube are used as implicit feedback to tailor recommendations for you, even if you don’t rate the videos explicitly. Another example of implicit feedback includes the items that you have browsed on Amazon, which are used to suggest other similar items for you.
The advantage of implicit feedback is that it is abundant. Recommender systems built using implicit feedback also allows us to tailor recommendations in real time, with every click and interaction. Today, online recommender systems are built using implicit feedback, which allows the system to tune its recommendation in real-time, with every user interaction.
